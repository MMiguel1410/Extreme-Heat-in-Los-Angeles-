# Project title

# Link to Proposal

# Roles 
1. Mariana, Data Analyst:
Mariana is mapping some of the demographic data (race and age) that is relevant to heat vulnerability in LA City. She is also mapping hospitals and medical centers. She will also work with other team members to map heat vulnerability. Mariana will also help visualize and clean any additional data that may be needed.

2. Amanda, Data Analyst:
Amanda is mapping some of the transportation-related factors such as “Means of Transportation to Work for Workers 16 Years and Over” and “Means of Transportation to Work (Renter-Occupied Housing Units).” She will continue to dive deeper to understand how the existing cooling center infrastructure is connected to public transit networks in LA City. She aims to identify gaps in both transit and cooling center accessibility. Amanda will also help visualize and clean any additional data that may be needed. 
3. Miguel, Statistic Analyst: Miguel is looking at housing occupancy such as renter versus owner occupied untis among Census tracts. He want to understand if the higher numbers of renters equates to increased levels of heat in the City. He will use current census data with the california healthy places index temperature projections. Since heat is our primary focus, Miguel also wants to comapre heat projection data across different time scales.
4. Michelle:
Michelle is looking at the overlay of disadvantaged communities, income levels, and extreme heat in Los Angeles. She is aiming to produce maps that visualize cooling center locations and their proximity to disadvantaged neighborhoods to better understand where gaps exist and how the City can expand access points to these centers during extreme heat events.

# Status update
The team has been excited to work on this project since we are all currently working together on the comprehensive planning project for the Climate Emergency Mobilization Office (CEMO) on this exact topic. Each sub-group from our comprehensive project (bus shelters, emergency calls, and cooling centers) is being represented by our group members so we are happy to come together and visualize maps that feature some aspect of the data from each of the different sub-groups. Since we have done a lot of background research on this topic, we know and are in agreement in the direction we want the project to go in.

# Data update
The project team is downloading demographic data largely from Social Explorer as CSV files and using boundary geometries from the County Of Los Angeles Enterprise GIS. We are accessing cooling centers location data from the City of Los Angeles GeoHub and SB 535/Disadvantaged Communities data from CalEnviroScreen. We are also mapping extreme heat vulnerability using data from the Healthy Place Index since they use Land Surface Temperature as the metric to measure heat. Additionally, we are all mapping amenities (bus shelters, cooling centers, and hospitals) that help communities deal with the impacts of extreme heat. 

# Concerns: 
1. Lack of data availability 
2. Lack of coding skills to fully map and analyze what we would like 
3. Repeating similar mapping tools that already exist
